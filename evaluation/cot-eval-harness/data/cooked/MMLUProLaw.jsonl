{"id": "MMLUPro-868", "problem": "A state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?\n\n(A) It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.\n(B) It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.\n(C) It goes against the spirit of the Twenty-fourth Amendment by effectively imposing a \"literacy tax.\"\n(D) It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.\n(E) It violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating write-in candidates differently.\n(F) It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.\n(G) It unreasonably limits the means by which a candidate can campaign, infringing on democratic practices.\n(H) It unreasonably restricts freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n(I) It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.\n(J) It interferes with the right to vote as guaranteed by the Nineteenth Amendment.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to J}.", "gt_solution": "F", "gt_answer": "F"}

This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende.

{"id": "MMLUPro-988", "problem": "An environmentalist was very interested in environmental issues, particularly protection of wetland areas. He decided to dig out the lawn in his back yard and turn the space into a swampy marsh. Eventually, his back yard was filled with tall grasses, reeds, and other marsh plants. A wide variety of frogs, turtles, snakes, birds, and other animals inhabited the yard. The ground was usually covered by several inches of standing water. The environmentalist's neighbors were not pleased with the condition of the environmentalist's yard. They complained that it produced foul odors, and they claimed that the standing water was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects. Several months after the environmentalist converted his yard into a marsh, a real estate investor purchased the house closest to the environmentalist's back yard swamp. The investor lived in a large city several hundred miles away, and he purchased the house next to the environmentalist's for investment purposes. The investor rented the house to a family under a long-term lease. The tenant family complained frequently to the investor about being annoyed by the environmentalist's yard. If the investor asserts a nuisance claim against the environmentalist, the environmentalist's best defense would be\n\n(A) that the investor failed to conduct a proper inspection of the property and surrounding area before purchasing the house.\n(B) that the investor owns the property but has rented it out, so the investor does not have actual possession or the right to immediate possession of the land.\n(C) that the environmentalist's yard is actually beneficial to the community by providing a natural habitat for local wildlife.\n(D) that the environmentalist has a right to use his property as he sees fit, as long as it does not harm others.\n(E) that the investor has not shown that the marsh has negatively affected the value of his property.\n(F) that the swampy condition of his yard attracts a variety of wildlife, which increases biodiversity.\n(G) that when the investor purchased the house, he knew or should have known about the swampy condition of the environmentalist's property.\n(H) that he had sound environmental reasons for maintaining the swampy condition of his yard.\n(I) that the standing water in his yard is not the source of the mosquito problem.\n(J) that turning his yard into a swampy marsh did not violate any zoning ordinance.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to J}.", "gt_solution": "B", "gt_answer": "B"}

Supreme Court decisions, the state regulation is probably\n\n(A) constitutional, because the state has a legitimate interest in ensuring the safety of its employees, and the headgear could potentially pose a safety risk.\n(B) unconstitutional, because the state's interest in maintaining a dress code does not outweigh the employee's right to freely exercise his religion.\n(C) unconstitutional, because in accordance with the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, a state has no power to regulate religious beliefs.\n(D) constitutional, because the interest of the state in vindicating a carefully considered professional judgment by the forestry director that wearing such religious apparel would interfere with the department's morale and efficiency is sufficient to contravene the wishes of its members to wear headgear required by their religious beliefs.\n(E) constitutional, because the regulation is neutral and generally applicable, and it does not target specific religions or religious practices.\n(F) constitutional, because the state has a compelling interest in maintaining uniformity and professionalism among its employees.\n(G) unconstitutional, because the state has failed to provide a less restrictive means of achieving its stated interest.\n(H) constitutional, because although the employee has a constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion, a state may impose reasonable regulations that are rationally related to the furtherance of a state interest.\n(I) unconstitutional, because an individual has a fundamental right to seek gainful employment, and a state cannot arbitrarily and unreasonably regulate against such economic activity.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to I}.", "gt_solution": "D", "gt_answer": "D"}

The graduate had been arrested as a juvenile for possession of marijuana. He was placed in a special drug education program for first- time juvenile offenders and was told that the arrest would be expunged. Since the graduate believed that he had been totally exonerated of criminal liability, he didn't report the arrest on his bar application form. The bar examiners had, in fact, received an anonymous letter making reference to the graduate's juvenile arrest and suggesting that he was not morally fit to be admitted as an attorney. In addition, the letter provided detailed information about the facts related to the offense. As a result, the examiners hired a special investigator, to look into the matter. As part of the investigator's inquiry, he went to the clerk of the juvenile court where the offense occurred and demanded access to the records concerning the graduate. The clerk refused, citing a state statute that required all court and police records relating to juveniles be sealed.

The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\n(A) No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law.\n(B) Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\n(C) No, because it changes the terms of contracts that have already been agreed upon and are in effect.\n(D) Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer.\n(E) No, because it infringes on the seller's right to manage their property as they see fit.\n(F) No, because it interferes with the agreed contractual terms between the buyer and seller.\n(G) No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to G}.", "gt_solution": "D", "gt_answer": "D"}

The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion.

The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died.

The apples had all been contaminated with a pesticide. The police then received a letter from a person who claimed responsibility for the poisonings.

While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes.

Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct?\n\n(A) Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.\n(B) Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he physically placed the bomb in the casino.\n(C) Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.\n(D) The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.\n(E) Both are guilty, but only the one who made the phone call is guilty of a felony.\n(F) Both are not guilty, because they intended to defuse the bomb before it exploded.\n(G) Both are guilty, but only the one who built the bomb is guilty of a felony.\n(H) Neither is guilty, because the faulty wire, an unforeseeable circumstance, caused the bomb to explode.\n(I) Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.\n(J) The co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty, because he made the demand for the money.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to J}.", "gt_solution": "A", "gt_answer": "A"}

Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women.

In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received.

{"id": "MMLUPro-1364", "problem": "In 1998, a farmer, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland.

{"id": "MMLUPro-1389", "problem": "A defendant was convicted of assault of a federal officer and imprisoned in a federal penitentiary. While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant. Should the defendant's motion be granted?\n\n(A) Yes, because the informant was acting as an agent of the government in a deceptive manner.\n(B) No, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive.\n(C) Yes, because the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into making the confession.\n(D) No, because the confession was made to a fellow inmate, not to a law enforcement official.\n(E) Yes, because the defendant was not read his Miranda rights before confessing to the informant.\n(F) Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.\n(G) No, because the defendant was not under direct questioning by law enforcement at the time of the confession.\n(H) No, because the confession was voluntary.\n(I) No, because the defendant was already convicted of a crime and thus lost his right to avoid self-incrimination.\n(J) No, because the defendant's safety in prison was not the responsibility of the informant.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to J}.", "gt_solution": "F", "gt_answer": "F"}

This destroyed the multi-unit plan and the city cancelled the permit, which the developer did not appeal.The developer's land value decreased from $2 million to $100,000.The developer sued the city in federal court on the basis that this was illegal spot zoning constituting a taking in violation of due process.Will the developer prevail with his federal constitutional claim?\n\n(A) Yes, the city cannot change zoning laws after issuing a building permit without compensating the developer.\n(B) No, the developer was aware of potential zoning changes and should have taken that into consideration.\n(C) No, the developer should have made a significant investment and appealed the city's decision.\n(D) Yes, because he got a building permit and justifiably relied on that approval \u0080\u0093 the rezoning was an illegal act once it granted a building permit.\n(E) Yes, the developer had a right to construct the planned units as per the original permit.\n(F) Yes, because the new zoning law disproportionately affected the developer compared to other landowners.\n(G) No, the city has the right to rezone land for the greater good of the community.\n(H) Yes, because the developer's loss was caused by discriminatory spot zoning that took its property without due process.\n(I) Yes, the state cannot cause such a dramatic diminution in an owner's property without paying just compensation.\n(J) No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to J}.", "gt_solution": "J", "gt_answer": "J"}

The mortgage deed contained the following clause immediately after the legal description of the 20 acres of timberland:\"Together with all the real property now owned by (the woman) or which shall be owned by (the woman) during the continuance of the indebtedness secured by this mortgage. \" This mortgage was given, as the recorded instrument revealed, to secure a note for $100,000 repayable over a 40-year term.

In April 2004, the woman executed and delivered to the finance company a mortgage to secure its loan. This mortgage was promptly and duly recorded.

If the court finds for the owner, what will be the likely reason?\n\n(A) The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.\n(B) The owner's purchase and integration of the adjacent parcel of land effectively nullifies the existing covenant.\n(C) The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist firstentered into the lease.\n(D) The discount drugstore on the adjacent parcel is not considered a 'new' lease, but a continuation of an existing one.\n(E) A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant wascreated.\n(F) The owner has the right to lease any part of his property to any business, regardless of existing leases.\n(G) The pharmacist did not adequately express his concerns to the owner before initiating legal action.\n(H) A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with theland.\n(I) The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shoppingcenter premises.\n(J) The covenant is not applicable as the shopping centers were considered separate entities at the time of the lease agreement.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to J}.", "gt_solution": "I", "gt_answer": "I"}

{"id": "MMLUPro-1558", "problem": "A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\n(A) The rancher, because the drought conditions give him priority access to the water.\n(B) The millionaire, as he was using the water first for his estate's needs.\n(C) The millionaire, because he has a right to the water for irrigation purposes.\n(D) Neither, because both have equal rights to the water as it runs through both of their properties.\n(E) The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n(F) The rancher, because the millionaire's use of the water is excessive and unnecessary.\n(G) The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\n(H) The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\n(I) The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\n(J) The millionaire, because he has been using the water for a longer period of time.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to J}.", "gt_solution": "H", "gt_answer": "H"}

The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees.

Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch.

Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags.

The ski lift company had installed and operated the lift pursuant to a concession agreement with the owner of the private park. Visitors gained entry to the park on payment of a $5 fee, which entitled them to go ice skating, tobogganing, or sledding. A ski lift ticket cost an additional $7 per day. At the top of the ski lift, there was a platform for embarking and disembarking passengers. The ski lift company paid the owner a stipulated rental plus 15 percent of the net proceeds from the lift. Two employees of the company operated the lift, one from a station at the bottom and the other from a station at the top of the hill. When the vacationer boarded the ski lift, it was late afternoon and most of the skiers had left. He was the sole passenger on the lift. Meanwhile, the employee at the top had left his post to go to the bathroom, asking his friend to keep watch on the lift and to stop it to allow any passengers to disembark. The friend consented, and the employee showed him how to use the control switch. When the vacationer approached the top, the employee was still away. Instead of stopping the lift to permit the vacationer to get off, the friend allowed the lift to keep moving. The vacationer was carried past the platform, and he was swung violently from side to side as the ski lift started downward. When the employee returned and sized up the situation, he threw the switch, stopping the lift.

{"id": "MMLUPro-1886", "problem": "Over the last several years, the economy of a state has substantially changed. The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?\n\n(A) The full faith and credit clause of Article IV, Section 1.\n(B) The third amendment's prohibition against quartering soldiers.\n(C) The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n(D) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\n(E) The establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n(F) The contract clause of Article I, Section 10.\n(G) The fourth amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n(H) The tenth amendment's reservation of powers to the states.\n(I) The commerce clause.\n(J) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to J}.", "gt_solution": "I", "gt_answer": "I"}

The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers.

The surgeon was assisted by a nurse who was assigned to the operation by the hospital.

On investigation, it turned out that the surgeon, who had bandaged him following the operation, had done so in such a manner as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the surgeon for malpractice, claiming $25,000 in damages. In his case-in-chief, the patient called the nurse to testifS' that shortly after the surgery, she saw the surgeon destroy the postoperative x-rays of the patient's abdomen. Upon objection by the surgeon's attorney, the trial judge should rule the nurse's testimony\n\n(A) admissible, but only if the surgeon is given an opportunity to refute the nurse's testimony.\n(B) inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n(C) inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.\n(D) admissible, if the patient can demonstrate that the destroyed x-rays would have supported his claim.\n(E) admissible, but leave the weight of the nurse's testimony to be determined by the jury.\n(F) inadmissible, as the x-rays were destroyed post-operation and do not pertain to the surgeon's performance during the surgery.\n(G) inadmissible, unless other evidence can corroborate the nurse's testimony.\n(H) admissible, only if the nurse can prove that the surgeon intentionally destroyed the x-rays.\n(I) inadmissible, because the nurse's testimony is hearsay.\nPlease write your final answer in the form of \\boxed{a letter from A to I}.", "gt_solution": "E", "gt_answer": "E"}

Two officers testified that they examined \"track\" marks on the defendant's arms and wrists, and that he admitted to past drug usage.

The trial court instructed the jury that it could find him guilty on proof that he was an addict, without proof of drug usage.
