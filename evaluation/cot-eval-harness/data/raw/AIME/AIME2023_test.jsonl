The probability that the person opposite to him is a woman is $\\frac{9}{13}$ since out of the $13$ people who can sit opposite to him, $9$ can be a woman. With the $2$nd man, we can use the same logic: there are $11$ people who can sit opposite to him, but only $8$ of them are a woman, so the probability is $\\frac{8}{11}.$ We use the same logic for the $3$rd, $4$th and $5$th men to get probabilities of $\\frac{7}{9}$, $\\frac{6}{7}$ and $\\frac{5}{5},$ respectively.\nMultiplying these probabilities, we get a final answer of \\[\\frac{9}{13}\\cdot\\frac{8}{11}\\cdot\\frac{7}{9}\\cdot\\frac{6}{7}\\cdot\\frac{5}{5}=\\frac{48}{143}\\longrightarrow\\boxed{191}.\\]\n~s214425 (Inspired by Math Jam)\nThis problem is equivalent to solving for the probability that no man is standing diametrically opposite to another man. We can simply just construct this.\nWe first place the $1$st man anywhere on the circle, now we have to place the $2$nd man somewhere around the circle such that he is not diametrically opposite to the first man. This can happen with a probability of $\\frac{12}{13}$ because there are $13$ available spots, and $12$ of them are not opposite to the first man.\nWe do the same thing for the $3$rd man, finding a spot for him such that he is not opposite to the other $2$ men, which would happen with a probability of $\\frac{10}{12}$ using similar logic. Doing this for the $4$th and $5$th men, we get probabilities of $\\frac{8}{11}$ and $\\frac{6}{10}$ respectively.\nMultiplying these probabilities, we get, \\[\\frac{12}{13}\\cdot\\frac{10}{12}\\cdot\\frac{8}{11}\\cdot\\frac{6}{10}=\\frac{48}{143}\\longrightarrow\\boxed{191}.\\]\n~s214425\nAssume that rotations and reflections are distinct arrangements, and replace men and women with identical M's and W's, respectively. (We can do that because the number of ways to arrange $5$ men in a circle and the number of ways to arrange $9$ women in a circle, are constants.) The total number of ways to arrange $5$ M's and $9$ W's is $\\binom{14}{5} = 2002.$\nTo count the number of valid arrangements (i.e. arrangements where every M is diametrically opposite a W), we notice that exactly $2$ of the pairs of diametrically opposite positions must be occupied by $2$ W's. There are $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways to choose these $2$ pairs. For the remaining $5$ pairs, we have to choose which position is occupied by an M and which is occupied by a W. This can be done in $2^{5} = 32$ ways. Therefore, there are $21*32 = 672$ valid arrangements. \nTherefore, the probability that an arrangement is valid is $\\frac{672}{2002} = \\frac{48}{143}$ for an answer of $\\boxed{191}.$\n~pianoboy\nTo start off, we calculate the total amount of ways to organize all $14$ people irrespective of any constraints. This is simply ${14\\choose5} = 2002$, because we just count how many ways we can place all $5$ men in any of the $14$ slots. \nSince men cannot be diametrically opposite with each other, because of the constraints, placing down one man in any given spot will make another spot on the opposite side of the circle unable to hold any men. This means that placing down one man will effectively take away $2$ spots. \nThere are $14$ possible slots the first man can be placed. Once that man was placed, the next man only have $12$ possible slots because the slot that the first man is in is taken and the diametrically opposite spot to the first man can't have any men. Similar logic applies for the third man, who has $10$ possible slots. The fourth man has $8$ possible slots, and the fifth man has $6$ possible slots.\nThis means the number of ways you can place all $5$ men down is $14 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6$. However, since the men are all indistinct from each other, you also have to divide that value by $5! = 120$, since there are $120$ ways to arrange the $5$ men in each possible positioning of the men on the circle. This means the total number of ways to arrange the men around the circle so that none of them are diametrically opposite of each other is: $\\frac{14 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6}{5!} = 672$. The women simply fill in the rest of the available slots in each arrangement of men.\nThus, the final probability is $\\frac{672}{2002} = \\frac{48}{143}$, meaning the answer is $48 + 143 = \\boxed{191}$.\n~ericshi1685\nWe will first assign seats to the men. The first man can be placed in any of the $14$ slots. The second man can be placed in any of the remaining $13$ seats, except for the one diametrically opposite to the first man. So, there are $13 - 1 = 12$ ways to seat him. With a similar argument, the third man can be seated in $10$ ways, the fourth man in $8$ ways and the last man in $6$ ways.  \nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the men is $14 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6$.    \nThe women go to the remaining $9$ spots. Note that since none of the seats diametrically opposite to the men is occupied, each man is opposite a woman. The number of ways to arrange the women is therefore, simply $9!$, meaning that the total number of ways to arrange the people with restrictions is $14 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 9!$ In general, there are $14!$ ways to arrange the people without restrictions. So, the probability is    \n\\[\\frac{14 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 9!}{14!} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 6}{13 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{48}{143}.\\]   \nThe answer is $48 + 143 = \\boxed{191}$.\n~baassid24\nFirst pin one man on one seat (to ensure no rotate situations). Then there are $13!$ arrangements.\nBecause $5$ men must have women at their opposite side, we consider the $2$nd man and the woman opposite as one group and name it $P_2.$ There are $4$ groups, $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ except the first man pinned on the same point. And for the rest $4$ women, name them $P_5$ and $P_6.$ First to order $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6,$ there are $6!$ ways. For the $1$st man, there are $9$ women to choose, $8$ for the $2$nd, $\\ldots,$ $5$ for the $5$th, and then for the $2$ women pairs $3$ and $1.$  Because every $2$ person in the group have chance to change their position, there are $2^6$ possibilities. \nSo the possibility is \\[P=\\frac{6!\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1 \\cdot 2^6}{13!}=\\frac{48}{143}.\\]\nThe answer is $48+143=\\boxed{191}.$\n~PLASTA\nWe get around the condition that each man can't be opposite to another man by simply considering all $7$ diagonals, and choosing $5$ where there will be a single man. For each diagonal, the man can go on either side, and there are $\\binom{14}{5}$ ways to arrange the men and the women in total. Thus our answer is $\\frac{\\binom{7}{5}\\cdot 2^5}{\\binom{14}{5}} = \\frac{48}{143}.$\nWe get $48 + 143 = \\boxed{191}$\n~AtharvNaphade\nWe can find the probability of one arrangement occurring, and multiply it by the total number of arrangements. \nThe probability of a man being in any specific position is $\\frac{5}{14}.$ The probability of a woman being across from him is $\\frac{9}{13}.$ The probability of a man being in any valid position is now $\\frac{4}{12},$ and the probability of a woman being across from him is $\\frac{8}{11},$ and so forth.

For each of these diagonals, the man can be on either side of the diagonal.\nIt follows that there are $2$ possibilities for each diagonal (man on one side, woman on the other, and vice versa). There are $5$ diagonals with a man and a woman, so there are $2^5$ different ways for these diagonals to appear. \nThere are $\\binom75$ successful diagonals, and for each of these diagonals, there are $2^5$ ways to seat the men and the women, there are $\\binom75$ $\\cdot 2^5$ successful outcomes. \nRecall that\n\\[P(\\mathrm{Any\\ successful\\ outcome})=P(\\mathrm{One\\ successful\\ outcome})\\cdot P(\\mathrm{Total\\ number\\ of\\ successful\\ outcomes}).\\]\nTherefore, \n\\[P(\\mathrm{Any\\ successful\\ outcome}) = \\frac{1}{2002}\\cdot 2^5\\cdot \\binom75 = \\frac{1}{2002}\\cdot 2^5\\cdot 21 = \\frac{2^5\\cdot 21}{2002} = \\frac{48}{143}.\\]\nThe requested sum is $48+143=\\boxed{191}.$\n-Benedict T (countmath1)", "answer": "191"}

Since for any real number $x$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le x \\le \\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1$, we have $U \\le U' \\le U + 2023$. Now, since $-1000 \\le U \\le 1000$, we have $-1000 \\le U' \\le 3023$.\nNow, we can solve for $U'$ in terms of $a$. We have:\n\\begin{align*} U' &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{n^2-na}{5}} \\\\ &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{n^2}{5} - \\frac{na}{5}} \\\\ &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{n^2}{5}} - \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{na}{5}} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {{n^2}} - \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {na}}{5} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\frac{2023(2023+1)(2023 \\cdot 2 + 1)}{6} - \\frac{a \\cdot 2023(2023+1)}{2} }{5} \\\\ &= \\frac{2023(2024)(4047-3a)}{30} \\\\ \\end{align*}\nSo, we have $U' = \\frac{2023(2024)(4047-3a)}{30}$, and $-1000 \\le U' \\le 3023$, so we have $-1000 \\le \\frac{2023(2024)(4047-3a)}{30} \\le 3023$, or $-30000 \\le 2023(2024)(4047-3a) \\le 90690$. Now, $2023 \\cdot 2024$ is much bigger than $90690$ or $30000$, and since $4047-3a$ is an integer, to satsify the inequalities, we must have $4047 - 3a = 0$, or $a = 1349$, and $U' = 0$.\nNow, we can find $U - U'$. We have:\n\\begin{align*} U - U' &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor} - \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\frac{n^2-1349n}{5}} \\\\ &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor - \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5}} \\end{align*}.\nNow, if $n^2-1349n \\equiv 0 \\text{ (mod 5)}$, then $\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor - \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} = 0$, and if $n^2-1349n \\equiv 1 \\text{ (mod 5)}$, then $\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor - \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} = -\\frac{1}{5}$, and so on. Testing with $n \\equiv 0,1,2,3,4, \\text{ (mod 5)}$, we get $n^2-1349n \\equiv 0,2,1,2,0 \\text{ (mod 5)}$ respectively. From 1 to 2023, there are 405 numbers congruent to 1 mod 5, 405 numbers congruent to 2 mod 5, 405 numbers congruent to 3 mod 5, 404 numbers congruent to 4 mod 5, and 404 numbers congruent to 0 mod 5. So, solving for $U - U'$, we get:\n\\begin{align*} U - U' &= \\sum^{2023}_{n=1} {\\lfloor \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5} \\rfloor - \\frac{n^2-1349n}{5}} \\\\ &= 404 \\cdot 0 - 405 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} - 405 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} - 405 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} - 404 \\cdot t0 \\\\ &= -405(\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{2}{5}) \\\\ &= -405 \\end{align*}\nSince $U' = 0$, this gives $U = -405$, and we have $a + U = 1349-405 = \\boxed{944}$.\n~ genius_007\nWe can view the floor function in this problem as simply subtracting the remainder of $n^2 - na$ (mod $5$) from the numerator of  \n$\\frac{n^2-na}{5}$. For example, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{7}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{7-2}{5} = 1$.\nNote that the congruence of  $n^2 - na$ (mod $5$) loops every time $n$ increases by 5. Also, note that the congruence of $a$ (mod $5$) determines the set of congruences of $n^2 - na$ for each congruence of $n$ (mod $5$). \nFor example, if $a \\equiv 1$ (mod $5$), the set of remainders is $(0, 2, 1, 2, 0)$ for $n \\equiv 1,2,3,4,0$ (mod $5$). Let the sum of these elements be $s$. Note that for each \u201cloop\u201d of the numerator (mod $5$), each element of the set will be subtracted exactly once, meaning $s$ is subtracted once for each loop. The value of the numerator will loop $404$ times (mod $5$) throughout the sum, as $5 \\cdot 404=2020$. Then \n$U \\approx \\frac {\\left( \\frac {n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - \\frac{(a)(n)(n+1)}{2}  -404s \\right)}{5}$\nWhere $n=2023$. Note that since $5 \\cdot 404=2020$, this is an approximation for $U$ because the equation disregards the remainder (mod $5$) when $n=2021, 2022$, and $2023$ so we must subtract the first 3 terms of our set of congruences one extra time to get the exact value of $U$ (*). However, we will find that this is a negligible error when it comes to the inequality $-1000<U<1000$, so we can proceed with this approximation to solve for $a$. \nFactoring our approximation gives $U \\approx \\frac {\\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1 - 3a)}{6}-404s}{5}$\n\nWe set $a= \\frac{(2n+1)}{3} = 1349$ to make $\\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1 - 3a)}{6}=0$, accordingly minimizing $|U|$, yielding  $U \\approx  \\frac{-404s}{5}$\nIf $a$ increases or decreases by $1$, then $U$ changes by $\\frac {(n)(n+1)}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac {2023 \\cdot 2024}{10}$\nwhich clearly breaks the inequality on $U$. Therefore $a=1349 \\equiv 4$ (mod $5$) giving the set of remainders $(2,1,2,0,0)$, so $s=5$ and our approximation yields $U \\approx -404$. However, we must subtract 2, 1, and 2 (*) giving us $U = - 404 - \\frac{(2+1+2)}{5} = - 405$, giving an answer of $1349-405= \\boxed{944}$\n~Spencer Danese\nConsider the integral\n\\[\\int_{0}^{2023} \\dfrac{n^2-na}{5} \\, dn.\\]\nWe hope this will give a good enough appoximation of $U$ to find $a.$ However, this integral can be easily evaluated(if you know calculus) to be\n\\[\\dfrac{1}{15}2023^3-\\dfrac{a}{10}2023^2=2023^2\\left(\\dfrac{2023}{15}-\\dfrac{a}{10}\\right).\\]\nBecause we want this to be as close to $0$ as possible, we find that $a$ should equal $1349.$ Then, evaluating the sum becomes trivial.

So, we must compute how many ways we can pick these numbers so that the set has no consecutive numbers other than (1,2). Our first option is to pick no more numbers, giving us $8 \\choose {0}$. We can also pick one number, giving us $7 \\choose {1}$ because 3 cannot be picked. Another choice is to pick two numbers and in order to make sure they are not consecutive we must fix one number in between them, giving us $6 \\choose {2}$. This pattern continues for each amount of numbers, yielding $5 \\choose {3}$ for 3 numbers and $4 \\choose {4}$ for four numbers. Adding these up, we have $8 \\choose {0}$ + $7 \\choose {1}$ + $6 \\choose {2}$ + $5 \\choose {3}$ + $4 \\choose {4}$ = $\\textbf{34}$.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2: (2,3)}$\nIf we have (2,3) as our pair, everything works the same as with (1,2), because 1 is still unusable as it is consecutive with 2. The only difference is we now have only 4-10 to work with. Using the same pattern as before, we have $7 \\choose {0}$ + $6 \\choose {1}$ + $5 \\choose {2}$ + $4 \\choose {3}$ = $\\textbf{21}$.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 3: (3,4)}$\nThis case remains pretty much the same except we now have an option of whether or not to include 1.

From here, we can construct a table of the values of $a_n$ until $n = 10.$ By listing out possibilities, we can solve for our first 3 values. \n\\[\\begin{array}{r|l} n & a_n \\\\ \\hline 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1\\\\ 3 & 2\\\\ 4 & 2 + 1 + F_2 = 5\\\\5 & 5 + 2 + F_3 = 10\\\\6 & 10 + 5 + F_4 = 20 \\\\ 7 & 20 + 10 + F_5 = 38\\\\ 8 & 38 + 20 + F_6 = 71 \\\\ 9& 71 + 38 + F_7 = 130\\\\ 10 & 130 + 71 + F_8 = 235 \\end{array}\\]\nOur answer is $a_{10} = \\boxed{235}.$\n~AtharvNaphade\nNote: This is a very common stars and bars application. \nCasework on number of terms, let the number of terms be $n$. We can come up with a generalized formula for the number  of subsets with n terms.\nLet $d_1, d_2, ..., d_{n-1}$ be the differences between the n terms. For example, in the set {2, 3, 6}, $d_1 = 1; d_2 = 3; d_3 = 5$\nLet the range of the set be k for now, $d_1 + ... + d_{n-1} = k$. We select one pair of terms to be consecutive by selecting one of the (n-1) terms to be 1. WLOG, let $d_1 = 1$. $1 + d_2 + ... + d_{n-1} = k$.\nTo ensure the other $d_2, d_3, ..., d_{n-1}$ are greater than 1 such that no two other terms are consecutive or the same, let $D_2 = d_2 + 1; D_3 = d_3 + 1; ...$. $(n-2) + 1 + D_2 + ... + D_{n-1} = k$ where $D_2, D_3, ..., D_{n-1}$ are positive integers.\nFinally, we add in $D_0$, the distance between 0 and the first term of the set, and $D_n$, the distance between the last term and 11. This way, the \"distance\" from 0 to 11 is \"bridged\" by $D_0$, k, and $D_N$.\n\\[D_0 + k + D_n = D_0 + ((n-1) + D_2 + ... + D_{n-1}) + D_N = 11\\]\n\\[D_0 + D_2 + D_3 + ... + D_n = 12 - n\\]\nThere are n positive terms, by [Balls and Urns](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Balls_and_Urns), there are ${(12-n)-1 \\choose (n)-1} = {11-n \\choose n-1}$ ways of doing this. However, recall that there were $(n-1)$ ways, and we had used a WLOG to choose which two digits are consecutive. The final formula for the number of valid n-element subsets is hence $(n-1){11-n \\choose n-1}$ for $n > 2$.\nCase 1: Two terms\n$n = 2$, so $(2-1){11-2 \\choose 2-1} = 1{9 \\choose 1} = 9$\nCase 2: Three terms\n$n = 3$, so $(3-1){11-3 \\choose 3-1} = 2{8 \\choose 2} = 56$\nCase 3: Four terms\n$n = 4$, so $(4-1){11-4 \\choose 4-1} = 3{7 \\choose 3} = 105$\nCase 4: Five terms\n$n = 5$, so $(5-1){11-5 \\choose 5-1} = 4{6 \\choose 4} = 60$\nCase 5: Six terms\n$n = 6$, so $(6-1){11-6 \\choose 6-1} = 5{5 \\choose 5} = 5$\nWe can check by the Pigeonhole principle that there cannot be more than six terms, so the answer is $9+56+105+60+5=\\boxed{235}$.\n~Mathandski\nNote that there are $F_{n+2}$ subsets of a set of $n$ consecutive integers that contains no two consecutive integers. (This can be proven by induction.)\nNow, notice that if we take $i$ and $i+1$ as the consecutive integers in our subset, we need to make a subset of the remaining integers such that it doesn't contain any two consecutive integers. Clearly, $i-1$ and $i+2$ cannot be chosen, and since $i-2$ and $i+3$ are sufficiently far apart, it is obvious we do not need to be concerned that an element of the set $\\{1, 2, ... , i-2 \\}$ is consecutive with any element of the set $\\{ i+3, i+4, ... , 10 \\}$\nThus, we can count the number of ways to choose a subset from the first set without any two elements being consecutive and multiply this by the number of ways to choose a subset from the second set without any two elements being consecutive. From above, and noting that the first set has $i-2$ consecutive integer elements and the second set has $8-i$ consecutive integer elements, we know that this is $F_i F_{10-i}.$\nSumming this over for all $1 \\leq i \\leq 9$ yields \\[\\sum_{i=1}^9 F_i F_{10-i} = F_1F_9 + F_2F_8 + F_3F_7 + F_4F_6 + F_5 F_5 + F_6 F_4 + F_7 F_3 + F_8 F_2 + F_9 F_1 = 2(F_1F_9 + F_2F_8 + F_3F_7+F_4F_6) + F_5^2 = 2(1 \\cdot 34 + 1 \\cdot 21 + 2 \\cdot 13 + 3 \\cdot 8) + 5^2 = 2 \\cdot 105+25 = \\boxed{235}.\\]\n~lpieleanu\nThe problem is the same as laying out a line of  polynomoes to cover spots $0,1,...10$: 1 triomino ($RGG$), $n$ dominoes ($RG$), and $8-2n$ monominoes ($R$).  The $G$ spots cover the members of the subset.\nThe total number spots is 11, because one $R$ spot always covers the 0, and the other spots cover 1 through 10.\nThere are 5 ways to choose polyomino sets, and many ways to order each set:\n$R + RG + RGG =$ Polyominoes $\\rightarrow$ Orderings \n$0 + 4 + 1 = 5 \\rightarrow 5! / 0!4!1! = ~~~5$\n$2 + 3 + 1 = 6 \\rightarrow 6! / 2!3!1! = ~60$\n$4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \\rightarrow 7! / 4!2!1! = 105$\n$6 + 1 + 1 = 8 \\rightarrow 8! / 6!1!1! = ~56$\n$8 + 0 + 1 = 9 \\rightarrow 9! / 8!0!1! = ~~~9$\nThe sum is $\\boxed{235}$.\n~BraveCobra22aops\nLet $dp(i)$ be the number of subsets of a set $i$ consecutive integers such that the maximum value in the set is $i$ and there exists exactly one pair of consecutive integers.

For one of the parallelepipeds, the three diagonals involving the origin have length $\\sqrt {21}$. Hence, $(u+v)\\cdot (u+v)=u\\cdot u+v\\cdot v+2u\\cdot v=21$ and $(u-v)\\cdot (u-v)=u\\cdot u+v\\cdot v-2u\\cdot v=31$.

Denote the parallelepiped with three acute angles meeting $P$, and the one with three obtuse angles meeting $P'$.\nThe area of a parallelepiped is simply the base area times the height, but because both parallelepipeds have the same base, what we want is just the ratio of the heights.\nDenote the point with three acute angles meeting at it in $P$ as $A$, and its neighbors $B$, $C$, and $D$. Similarly, denote the point with three obtuse angles meeting at it in $P'$ as $A'$, and its neighbors $B'$, $C'$, and $D'$.\nWe have the following equations:\n\\[\\textrm{Height of }P\\textrm{ from }ACD = \\frac{\\textrm{Vol}(ABCD) \\cdot 3}{[ACD]},\\]\n\\[\\textrm{Height of }P'\\textrm{ from }A'C'D' = \\frac{\\textrm{Vol}(A'B'C'D') \\cdot 3}{[A'C'D']}.\\]\nHowever, $ACD$ and $A'C'D'$ are both half the area of a rhombus with diagonals $\\sqrt{31}$ and $\\sqrt{21}$, so our ratio is really\n\\[\\frac{P}{P'} = \\frac{\\textrm{Vol}(ABCD)}{\\textrm{Vol}(A'B'C'D')}.\\]\nBecause the diagonals of all of the faces are $\\sqrt{31}$ and $\\sqrt{21}$, each edge of the parallelepipeds is $\\sqrt{13}$ by the Pythagorean theorem. \nWe have $AB = AC = AD = \\sqrt{13}$, and $BC = CD = BD = \\sqrt{21}$. When we drop a perpendicular to the centroid of $BCD$ from $A$ (let's call this point $O$), we have $BO = \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{7}$.

In other words, Felix the frog starts his journey at $(0,0)$ in the coordinate plane.  Every second, he jumps either to the right or up, until he reaches an $x$- or $y$-coordinate of $12$.  At this point, if he tries to jump to a coordinate outside the square from $(0,0)$ to $(11,11)$, he \"wraps around\" and ends up at an $x$- or $y$- coordinate of $0$.

In fact, a link between some $A_i$ and $A_j$ fully determines the rest of the cycle, as the path from $A_{i+1}$ must \"hug\" the path from $A_i$, to ensure that there are no gaps.  We therefore see that if $A_0$ leads to $A_k$, then $A_i$ leads to $A_{i+k}$.  Only the values of $k$ relatively prime to $12$ result in solutions, though, because otherwise $A_0$ would only lead to $\\{A_i:\\exists n\\in \\mathbb Z:i\\equiv kn\\quad\\text{mod 12}\\}$.

Your goal is to have a single path across all nodes on the grid leading back to $(0,\\ 0)$. For convenience, any grid position are presumed to be in $\\mod N$.\nNote that there are exactly two ways to reach node $(i,\\ j)$, namely $(i - 1,\\ j)$ and $(i,\\ j - 1)$. \nAs a result, if a path includes a step from $(i,\\ j)$ to $(i + 1,\\ j)$, there cannot be a step from $(i,\\ j)$ to $(i,\\ j + 1)$. However, a valid solution must reach $(i,\\ j + 1)$, and the only valid step is from $(i - 1,\\ j + 1)$.\nSo a solution that includes a step from $(i,\\ j)$ to $(i + 1,\\ j)$ dictates a step from $(i - 1,\\ j + 1)$ to $(i,\\ j + 1)$ and by extension steps from $(i - a,\\ j + a)$ to $(i - a + 1,\\ j + a)$. We observe the equivalent result for steps in the orthogonal direction.\nThis means that in constructing a valid solution, taking one step in fact dictates N steps, thus it's sufficient to count valid solutions with $N = a + b$ moves of going right $a$ times and $b$ times up the grid. The number of distinct solutions can be computed by permuting 2 kinds of indistinguishable objects $\\binom{N}{a}$.\nHere we observe, without proof, that if $\\gcd(a, b) \\neq 1$, then we will return to the origin prematurely. For $N = 12$, we only want to count the number of solutions associated with $12 = 1 + 11 = 5 + 7 = 7 + 5 = 11 + 1$.\n(For those attempting a rigorous proof, note that $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a + b, b) = \\gcd(N, b) = \\gcd(N, a)$).\nThe total number of solutions, noting symmetry, is thus\n\\[2\\cdot\\left(\\binom{12}{1} + \\binom{12}{5}\\right) = 1608\\]\nThis yields $\\boxed{\\textbf{608}}$ as our desired answer.\n~ cocoa @ [https://www.corgillogical.com/](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://www.corgillogical.com/)\nDefine a $12 \\times 12$ matrix $X$.\nEach entry $x_{i, j}$ denotes the number of movements the longer hand moves, given that two hands jointly make $12 \\left( i - 1 \\right) + \\left( j - 1 \\right)$ movements.\nThus, the number of movements the shorter hand moves is $12 \\left( i - 1 \\right) + \\left( j - 1 \\right) - x_{i, j}$.\nDenote by $r_{i, j}$ the remainder of $x_{i, j}$ divided by 12.\nDenote by $R$ this remainder matrix.\nIf two hands can return to their initial positions after 144 movements, then $r_{12, 12} = 0$ or 11.\nDenote by $S_0$ (resp. $S_{11}$) the collection of feasible sequences of movements, such that $r_{12, 12} = 0$ (resp. $r_{12, 12} = 11$).\nDefine a function $f\u00a0:  S_0 \\rightarrow S_{11}$, such that for any $\\left\\{ x_{i,j} , \\ \\forall \\ i, j \\in \\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , 12 \\right\\} \\right\\} \\in S_0$, the functional value of the entry indexed as $\\left( i, j \\right)$ is $12 \\left( i - 1 \\right) + \\left( j - 1 \\right) - x_{i, j}$.\nThus, function $f$ is bijective.

Suppose there exist $i < i'$, $j$, such that $r_{i, j} = r_{i', j}$. Then this entails that the positions of two hands after the $\\left( 12 \\left( i' - 1 \\right) + \\left( j - 1 \\right) \\right)$th movement coincide with their positions after the  $\\left( 12 \\left( i - 1 \\right) + \\left( j - 1 \\right) \\right)$th movement.\n\\item For any $j \\in \\left\\{ 1, 2 ,\\cdots , 11 \\right\\}$, $x_{i, j+1} - x_{i, j}$ is equal to either 0 for all $i$ or 1 for all $i$.\nThe reasoning is as follows. If this does not hold and the $j$th column in $R$ is a permutation of $\\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots , 12 \\right\\}$, then the $j+1$th column is no longer a permutation of $\\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots , 12 \\right\\}$. This leads to the infeasibility of the movements.\n\\item $x_{i+1, 1} = x_{i, 12}$ for any $i \\in \\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , 11 \\right\\}$.\nThis follows from the conditions that the $12$th column in $R$ excluding $r_{12, 12}$ and the first column in $R$ excluding $x_{1, 1}$ are both permutations of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , 11 \\right\\}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nAll observations jointly imply that $x_{i, 12} = i \\cdot x_{1, 12}$.\nThus, $\\left\\{ r_{1, 12}, r_{2, 12} , \\cdots , r_{11, 12} \\right\\}$ is a permutation of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , 11 \\right\\}$.\nThus, $x_{1, 12}$ is relatively prime to 12.\nBecause $x_{1, 1} = 0$ and $x_{1, 12} - x_{1, 1} \\leq 11$, we have $x_{1, 12} = 1$, 5, 7, or 11.\nRecall that when we move from $x_{1, 1}$ to $x_{1, 12}$, there are 11 steps of movements. Each movement has $x_{1, j+1} - x_{i, j} = 0$ or 1.\nThus, for each given $x_{1, 12}$, the number of feasible movements from $x_{1, 1}$ to $x_{1, 12}$ is $\\binom{11}{x_{1, 12}}$.\nTherefore, the total number of feasible movement sequences in this problem is\n\\begin{align*} | S_0 | + | S_{11} | & = 2 | S_0 | \\\\ & = 2 \\cdot \\sum_{x_{1, 12} = 1, 5, 7, 11} \\binom{11}{x_{1, 12}} \\\\ & = 2 \\left( 11 + 462 + 330 + 1 \\right) \\\\ & = 1608 . \\end{align*}\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(608) }}$.\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)", "answer": "608"}

Since $AC$ and $BD$ are diameters of the circle, $\\triangle APC$ and $\\triangle BPD$ are right triangles. Let $X$ and $Y$ be the foot of the altitudes to $AC$ and $BD$, respectively. We have\n\\[[\\triangle APC] = \\frac{1}{2}(PA)(PC) = \\frac{1}{2}(PX)(AC),\\]\nso $PX = \\dfrac{(PA)(PC)}{AC} = \\dfrac{28}{r}$. Similarly,\n\\[[\\triangle BPD] = \\frac{1}{2}(PB)(PD) = \\frac{1}{2}(PY)(PB),\\]\nso $PY = \\dfrac{(PB)(PD)}{BD} = \\dfrac{45}{r}$. Since $\\triangle APX \\sim \\triangle PCX,$\n\\[\\frac{AX}{PX} = \\frac{PX}{CX}\\]\n\\[\\frac{AO - XO}{PX} = \\frac{PX}{OC + XO}.\\]\nBut $PXOY$ is a rectangle, so $PY = XO$, and our equation becomes\n\\[\\frac{r - PY}{PX} = \\frac{PX}{r + PY}.\\]\nCross multiplying and rearranging gives us $r^2 = PX^2 + PY^2 = \\left(\\dfrac{28}{r}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\dfrac{45}{r}\\right)^2$, which rearranges to $r^4 = 2809$. Therefore $[ABCD] = 2r^2 = \\boxed{106}$.\n~Cantalon\nDrop a height from point $P$ to line $\\overline{AC}$ and line $\\overline{BC}$. Call these two points to be $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Notice that the intersection of the diagonals of $\\square ABCD$ meets at a right angle at the center of the circumcircle, call this intersection point $O$.\nSince $OXPY$ is a rectangle, $OX$ is the distance from $P$ to line $\\overline{BD}$. We know that $\\tan{\\angle{POX}} = \\frac{PX}{XO} = \\frac{28}{45}$ by triangle area and given information. Then, notice that the measure of $\\angle{OCP}$ is half of $\\angle{XOP}$.\nUsing the half-angle formula for tangent,\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{(2 \\cdot \\tan{\\angle{OCP}})}{(1-\\tan^2{\\angle{OCP}})} = \\tan{\\angle{POX}} = \\frac{28}{45} \\\\ 14\\tan^2{\\angle{OCP}} + 45\\tan{\\angle{OCP}} - 14 = 0 \\end{align*}\nSolving the equation above, we get that $\\tan{\\angle{OCP}} = -7/2$ or $2/7$. Since this value must be positive, we pick $\\frac{2}{7}$. Then, $\\frac{PA}{PC} = 2/7$ (since $\\triangle CAP$ is a right triangle with line $\\overline{AC}$ the diameter of the circumcircle) and $PA * PC = 56$.

Hence, we want to find $k^2$. Let the center of the circle be $(0,0)$.\nThe two equations would thus become:\n\\[\\left(\\left(a+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2+\\left(b-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2\\right)\\left(\\left(a-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2+\\left(b+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2\\right)=56^2\\]\n\\[\\left(\\left(a-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2+\\left(b-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2\\right)\\left(\\left(a+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2+\\left(b+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2\\right)=90^2\\]\nNow, let $m=\\left(a+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2$, $n=\\left(a-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2$, $o=\\left(b+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2$, and $p=\\left(b-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2$. Our equations now change to $(m+p)(n+o)=56^2=mn+op+mo+pn$ and $(n+p)(m+o)=90^2=mn+op+no+pm$. Subtracting the first from the second, we have $pm+no-mo-pn=p(m-n)-o(m-n)=(m-n)(p-o)=34\\cdot146$. Substituting back in and expanding, we have $2ak\\cdot-2bk=34\\cdot146$, so $abk^2=-17\\cdot73$. We now have one of our terms we need ($k^2$). Therefore, we only need to find $ab$ to find $k^2$.\nWe now write the equation of the circle, which point $P$ satisfies: \\[a^2+b^2=\\left(\\dfrac{k\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{k^2}2\\]\nWe can expand the second equation, yielding \\[\\left(a^2+b^2+\\dfrac{k^2}2+(ak+bk)\\right)\\left(a^2+b^2+\\dfrac{k^2}2-(ak+bk)\\right)=(k^2+k(a+b))(k^2-k(a+b))=8100.\\]\nNow, with difference of squares, we get $k^4-k^2\\cdot(a+b)^2=k^2(k^2-(a+b)^2)=8100$. We can add $2abk^2=-17\\cdot73\\cdot2=-2482$ to this equation, which we can factor into $k^2(k^2-(a+b)^2+2ab)=k^2(k^2-(a^2+b^2))=8100-2482$. We realize that $a^2+b^2$ is the same as the equation of the circle, so we plug its equation in: $k^2\\left(k^2-\\dfrac{k^2}2\\right)=5618$. We can combine like terms to get $k^2\\cdot\\dfrac{k^2}2=5618$, so $(k^2)^2=11236$.\nSince the answer is an integer, we know $11236$ is a perfect square. Since it is even, it is divisible by $4$, so we can factor $11236=2^2\\cdot2809$. With some testing with approximations and last-digit methods, we can find that $53^2=2809$. Therefore, taking the square root, we find that $k^2$, the area of square $ABCD$, is $2\\cdot53=\\boxed{106}$.\n~wuwang2002\nWLOG, let $P$ be on minor arc $AD.$ Draw in $AP$, $BP$, $CP$, $DP$ and let $\\angle ABP = x.$  We can see, by the inscribed angle theorem, that $\\angle APB = \\angle ACB = 45$, and $\\angle CPD = \\angle CAD = 45.$ Then, $\\angle PAB = 135-x$, $\\angle PCD = \\angle PAD = (135-x)-90 = 45-x$, and $\\angle PDC = 90+x.$ Letting $(PA, PB, PC, PD, AB) = (a,b,c,d,s)$, we can use the law of sines on triangles $PAB$ and $PCD$ to get \\[s\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{\\sin(x)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(135-x)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(90+x)} = \\frac{d}{\\sin(45-x)}.\\] Making all the angles in the above equation acute gives \\[s\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{\\sin(x)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(45+x)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(90-x)} = \\frac{d}{\\sin(45-x)}.\\]\nNote that we are looking for $s^{2}.$ We are given that $ac = 56$ and $bd = 90.$ This means that\n$s^{2}\\sin(x)\\sin(90-x) = 28$ and $s^{2}\\sin(45+x)\\sin(45-x) = 45.$ However, \\[\\sin(x)\\sin(90-x) = \\sin(x)\\cos(x) = \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{2}\\] and \\[\\sin(45+x)\\sin(45-x) = \\frac{(\\cos(x) + \\sin(x))(\\cos(x) - \\sin(x))}{2} = \\frac{\\cos^{2}(x) - \\sin^{2}(x)}{2} = \\frac{\\cos(2x)}{2}.\\]  Therefore, $s^{2}\\sin(2x) = 56$ and $s^{2}\\cos(2x) = 90.$ Therefore, by the Pythagorean Identity, \\[s^{2} = \\sqrt{(s^{2}\\sin(2x))^{2} + (s^{2}\\cos(2x))^{2}} = \\sqrt{56^{2} + 90^{2}} = \\boxed{106}.\\]\n~pianoboy\nSimilar to Solution 6, let $P$ be on minor arc $\\overarc {AB}$, $r$ and $O$ be the radius and center of the circumcircle respectively, and $\\theta = \\angle AOP$.

If Alice is right (with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$), there is now 1 black and red card each, so the expected number of cards guessed is $E_1$; if she is wrong (with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$), there are 2 black cards left, so Alice can guess these with certainty.\nSumming this up into a formula:\n\\[E_3 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{5} \\left(1 + E_2 \\right) + \\frac{2}{5} \\left( \\frac{1}{4}(3) + \\frac{3}{4}\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3}\\left(1 + E_1 \\right) + \\frac{1}{3}(2)\\right) \\right)\\]\nWe can apply similar logic to compute $E_2$ and get\n\\[E_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3}(1 + E_1) + \\frac{1}{3}(2)\\]\nTo compute $E_1$, we know that Alice can guess the last card with certainty, and there's a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance they get the first card as well, so $E_1 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThus, $E_2 = \\frac{17}{6}$, and after long computation, we get $E_3 = \\frac{41}{10}$.

So we subtract by one and we conclude that there are $10$ ordered pairs of $(a,b)$ that satisfy this case.\n\nThis all shows that there are a total of $8+10 = 18$ amount of ordered pairs $(a,b).$ Multiplying this by $41$ (the amount of values for $c$) we get $18\\cdot41=\\boxed{738}$ as our final answer.\n~s214425\n$p(x)-p(2)$ is a cubic with at least two integral real roots, therefore it has three real roots, which are all integers.\nThere are exactly two distinct roots, so either $p(x)=p(2)+(x-2)^2(x-m)$ or $p(x)=p(2)+(x-2)(x-m)^2$, with $m\\neq 2$.\nIn the first case $p(x)=x^3-(4+m)x^2+(4+4m)x-4m+p(2)$, with $|4+4m|\\leq 20$ (which entails $|4+m|\\leq 20$), so $m$ can be $-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1, (\\textbf{not 2}!), 3,4$ and $-4m+p(2)$ can be any integer from $-20$ to $20$, giving $410$ polynomials (since the coefficients are given by linear functions of $m$ and thus are distinct). \nIn the second case $p(x)=x^3-(2+2m)x^2+(4m+m^2)x-2m^2+p(2)$, and $m$ can be $-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1$ and $-4m+p(2)$ can be any integer from $-20$ to $20$, giving $328$ polynomials.\nThe total is $\\boxed{738}$.\n~EVIN-", "answer": "738"}

(since $3+3>5$). Since there are $16$ subsets of $A$ that have size $3$ or higher, there is only one possibility for this case.\n\nCase 2: There are only sets of size $2$ or higher in $S$:  \nFirstly, there cannot be a no size $2$ set $S$, or it will be overcounting the first case.\nIf there is only one such size $2$ set, there are $10$ ways to choose it. That size $2$ set, say $X$, cannot be in $S$ with $Y = A/X$ (a three element set). Thus, there are only $15$ possible size $3$ subsets that can be in $S$, giving us $10$ for this case.\nIf there are two sets with size $2$ in $S$, we can choose the common elements of these two subsets in $5$ ways, giving us a total of $5\\cdot 6 = 30$.\nIf there are three sets with size $2$, they can either share one common element, which can be done in $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ ways, or they can share pairwise common elements (sort of like a cycle), which can be done $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways. In total, we have $30$ possibilities.\nIf there are four sets with size $2$, they all have to share one common element, which can be done in $5\\cdot 1$ ways.\nThus, summing everything up, this will give us $75$ possible sets $S$\n\nCase 3: There is a set with size $1$ in $S$:  \nNotice that be at most one size $1$ subset. There are $5$ ways to choose that single element set. Say it's $\\{ 1\\}$. All other subsets in $S$ must have a $1$ in them, but there are only $2^4-1 = 15$ of them. Thus this case yields $5\\cdot 1 = 5$ possibilities.\n\nThus, the total number of sets $S$ would be $1+75+5 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(081)}}$.\n~sml1809\nFirstly, there cannot be two subsets with cardinality 1, or they will not intersect.\nIf there is one subset $A$ with cardinality $1$; let the element in $A$ be $a$, then there are $2^4=16$ subsets that do not include $a$ so they do not work. Every remaining subsets $S$ will have $a$ as an element so $S\\cap{A}\\geq1$, since we just excluded all that do not. Since there are 15 subsets left, all are forced into the group of 16 subsets, so we just choose the number of $a$ to determine the set $A$. $A\\in\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ so there are 5 ways.\nFor the rest of the cases, we assume there are no sets $A$ with cardinality 1.  Notice that the only way to \"violate\" the condition is to have subsets $X$ and $Y$ with cardinalities 2 and 3 in some order. Otherwise, by the Pigeonhole Principle, if two sets both have cardinalities more than 3, they are bound to have one element of intersection. Say a set $S$ has $|S|=2$, then there is clearly only one set $s$ that will make $S\\cap{s}=0$. By our previous claim, all other subsets that have cardinality $c\\geq{3}$ will work.\nNow if we generalize a bit: If a subset has $N$ 2-element subsets which belong to set $M$, then there are exactly $N$ subsets with cardinality 3 that don't work. Therefore, the number of \"violating subsets\" are all subsets with cardinality $c\\leq{1}$, all 2-element subsets that are not in $M$, and all corresponding cardinality 3 subsets. Subtracting from the total 32 subsets, we get that $32-(1+5+(10-N)+N)=16$ subsets that do work. This includes all subsets in $M$, so the remaining non-violating subsets are forced. This is equivalent now to choosing $N$ 2 element subsets.\nFollowing casework on the number of 2-element subsets:\nIf $N=1$: There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways.\nIf $N=2$: There are $5$ ways to choose the intersection between the 2 sets (remember they have to have at least one element of intersection) and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the distinct elements in the subsets, so there are $5*6=30$ ways.\nIf $N=3$: It can be a cycle, where WLOG let the elements be $a,b,c$ so the sets are $\\{a,b\\}$, $\\{b,c\\}$, and $\\{c,a\\}$. This is just $\\binom{5}{3}=10$. Alternatively, it can also be the case where all sets share one element. There are 5 ways to choose this element and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the remaining elements to assign to each set. There are $30$ ways.\nIf $N=4$: By the Pigeonhole Principle, the only way all pairwise sets have at one common intersection is if all share one element in common. There are 5 ways to choose this element and the remaining numbers are forced. There are 5 ways.\n$N\\geq{5}$ does not provide any valid cases since to have all pairwise elements to intersect one element, they must be the same element by the Pigeonhole Principle, but there are not enough subsets.\nIf $N=0$, then there is only one way since $\\binom{5}{3}+\\binom{5}{4}+\\binom{5}{5}=16$.\nAdding all cases yields $5+10+30+30+5+1=\\boxed{81}$ ways!\n-Magnetoninja", "answer": "081"}

There are two ways to easily show this:\n$\\textbf{Competition solution:}$\nNotice that the problem statement tells us that point Q is $\\textit{unique.}$ EVERY piece of information in the problem statement is intentional, so we should try to use this to our benefit. None of the other solutions do, which is why they are more complicated than they need be.\nConsider point Q' s.t. $Q'M = MP$. Obviously, $\\angle Q'CP$ and $\\angle Q'BP$ are equal - we have perfect symmetry along line $AP$. Moreover, $BQ'CP$ is a parallelogram as its diagonals bisect each other. Since point $Q$ is unique, we know that $Q' \\textit{is } Q$. Thus $BQCP$ is a parallelogram. $\\blacksquare$\n$\\newline$\n$\\textbf{Rigorous proof (not recommended for competition scenario):}$\nConsider any quadrilateral $ABCD$ whose diagonals intersect at $O$ s.t. $AO = OC$ and $\\angle BAD = \\angle BCD$. We will prove that $ABCD$ is $\\textit{either a \\textbf{parallelogram} or a \\textbf{kite}}$. \n(Note that in our problem, since $AP$ and $BC$ are not orthogonal, ($ABC$ isn't isosceles) this is enough to show that $BQCP$ is a parallelogram).\n$\\newline$\n-- By same base/same altitude, $[ABO] = [CBO]$ and $[ADO] = [CDO] \\implies [ABD] = [ABO] + [ADO] = [CBO] + [CDO] = [CBD]. \\newline$\nTherefore: $\\frac{1}{2} sin(\\angle BAD) \\overline{AB} \\times \\overline{AD} = \\frac{1}{2} sin(\\angle BCD) \\overline{CB} \\times \\overline{CD}.$ Since $\\angle BAD = \\angle BCD$, this reduces to $\\overline{AB} \\times \\overline{AD} = \\overline{CB} \\times \\overline{CD}. (E.1) \\newline$\nLet $AB = x$ and $AD = y$. Then, by $(E.1)$, $CB = kx$ and $CD = \\frac{y}{k}$ for some real $k$. Then by LoC on $\\triangle BAD$ and $\\triangle BCD$:\n$x^{2} + y^{2} - 2xy cos(\\angle BAD) = \\overline{BD} = x^{2}k^{2} + \\frac{y^{2}}{k^{2}} - 2xy cos(\\angle BCD) \\newline \\implies x^{2} + y^{2} = x^{2}k^{2} + \\frac{y^{2}}{k^{2}} \\newline \\implies (y^{2} - x^{2}k^{2})(k^{2} - 1) = 0.\\newline$\n-- $y^{2} - x^{2}k^{2} = 0 \\implies y = kx \\implies AD = BC$ and $AB = CD \\implies$ $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.\n-- $k^{2} - 1 = 0 \\implies k = 1$ ($k$ cannot be $-1$; no negative sided polygons here!) $\\implies AB = CB$ and $AD = CD \\implies$ $ABCD$ is a kite. $\\square$. ~Mathavi\nFirst, note that by Law of Sines, $\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QBP})}{QP}=\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{BPQ})}{BQ}$ and that $\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QCP})}{QP}=\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QPC})}{QP}$. Equating the 2 expressions, you get that $\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{BPQ})}{BQ}=\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QPC})}{QP}$. Now drop the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. As it is commonly known that the dropped altitude forms a $5-12-13$ and a $9-12-15$ triangle, you get the measures of $\\angle{ABC}$ and $\\angle{ACB}$ respectively, which are $\\arcsin(\\frac{12}{13})$ and $\\arcsin(\\frac{4}{5})$. However, by the inscribed angle theorem, you get that $\\angle{BPQ}=\\arcsin(\\frac{4}{5})$ and that $\\angle{QPC}=\\arcsin(\\frac{12}{13})$, respectively. Therefore, by Law of Sines (as previously stated) $\\frac{BQ}{CQ}=\\frac{13}{15}$.\nNow commence coordbashing. Let $B$ be the origin, and $A$ be the point $(5,12)$. As $AP$ passes through $A$, which is $(5,12)$, and $M$, which is $(7,0)$, it has the equation $-6x+42$, so therefore a point on this line can be written as $(x,42-6x)$. As we have the ratio of the lengths, which prompts us to write the lengths in terms of the distance formula, we can just plug and chug it in to get the ratio $\\frac{\\sqrt{37x^2-504x+1764}}{\\sqrt{37x^2-532x+1960}}=\\frac{13}{15}$. This can be squared to get $\\frac{37x^2-504x+1764}{37x^2-532x+1960}=\\frac{169}{225}$. This can be solved to get a solution of $x=\\frac{469}{74}$, and an extraneous solution of $5$ which obviously doesn\u2019t work. \nPlugging $x$ into the line equation gets you $y=\\frac{147}{37}$. The distance between this point and $A$, which is $(5,12)$ is $\\sqrt{\\frac{9801}{148}}$, or simplified to $\\frac{99}{\\sqrt{148}}\\Longrightarrow99+148=\\boxed{247}$\n~dragoon (minor $\\LaTeX$ fixes by rhydon516)\n[2023 AIME II 12.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:2023_AIME_II_12.png)\nWe use the law of Cosine and get \\[AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 - 2 AM \\cdot BM \\cos \\angle AMB,\\] \\[AC^2 = AM^2 + CM^2 + 2 AM \\cdot CM \\cos \\angle AMB \\implies\\] \\[AM^2 = \\frac {AB^2 + AC^2}{2}- BM^2 = \\sqrt{148} \\approx 12.\\]\nWe use the power of point $M$ with respect circumcircle $\\triangle ABC$ and get \n\\[AM \\cdot MP = BM \\cdot CM = BM^2 \\implies\\]\n\\[PM = \\frac {49}{\\sqrt {148}} \\approx \\frac {48}{12} \\approx 4 < AM.\\]\nIt is clear that if $Q = P,$ then $\\angle PBQ = \\angle PCQ = 0 \\implies$\nif $Q$ is symmetric to $P$ with respect $M$ then $\\angle PBQ = \\angle PCQ.$\nThere exists a unique point $Q$ on segment $\\overline{AM}, PM < AM \\implies$\n\\[PQ = AM - PM = \\frac{99}{\\sqrt{148}} \\implies \\boxed{247}.\\]\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss", "answer": "247"}

If not, $a_n = a_{n-1} + 23 \\cdot 2^{n-1}$.\nThis encourages us to let $b_n = \\frac{a_n - 1}{2^n}$. Rewriting the above equations, we have\n\\[b_n = \\begin{cases} \\frac{b_{n-1}}{2} & \\text{if } 2 \\text{ } \\vert \\text{ } b_{n-1} \\\\ \\frac{b_{n-1}+23}{2} &\\text{if } 2 \\not\\vert \\text{ } b_{n-1} \\end{cases}\\]\nThe first few values of $b_n$ are $11, 17, 20, 10, 5, 14, 7, 15, 19, 21,$ and $22$. We notice that $b_{12} = b_1 = 11$, and thus the sequence is periodic with period $11$.\nNote that $a_n = a_{n+1}$ if and only if $b_n$ is even. This occurs when $n$ is congruent to $0, 3, 4$ or $6$ mod $11$, giving four solutions for each period.\nFrom $1$ to $1001$ (which is $91 \\times 11$), there are $91 \\times 4 = 364$ values of $n$. We subtract $1$ from the total since $1001$ satisfies the criteria but is greater than $1000$ to get a final answer of $\\fbox{363}$ .\n~[Bxiao31415](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Bxiao31415)\n(small changes by bobjoebilly and [IraeVid13](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Iraevid13))\nWe first check that $\\gcd(23, 2^n) = 1$ hence we are always seeking a unique modular inverse of $23$, $b_n$, such that $a_n \\equiv 23b_n \\equiv 1 \\mod{2^n}$.\n\nNow that we know that $b_n$ is unique, we proceed to recast this problem in binary. This is convenient because $x \\mod{2^n}$ is simply the last $n$-bits of $x$ in binary, and if $x \\equiv 1 \\mod{2^n}$, it means that of the last $n$ bits of $x$, only the rightmost bit (henceforth $0$th bit) is $1$.\nAlso, multiplication in binary can be thought of as adding shifted copies of the multiplicand. For example:\n\\begin{align} 10111_2 \\times 1011_2 &= 10111_2 \\times (1000_2 + 10_2 + 1_2) \\\\               &= 10111000_2 + 101110_2 + 10111_2 \\\\               &= 11111101_2 \\end{align}\nNow note $23 = 10111_2$, and recall that our objective is to progressively zero out the $n$ leftmost bits of $a_n = 10111_2 \\times b_n$ except for the $0$th bit. \nWrite $b_n = \\underline{c_{n-1}\\cdots c_2c_1c_0}_2$, we note that $c_0$ uniquely defines the $0$th bit of $a_n$, and once we determine $c_0$, $c_1$ uniquely determines the $1$st bit of $a_n$, so on and so forth. \nFor example, $c_0 = 1$ satisfies $a_1 \\equiv10111_2 \\times 1_2 \\equiv 1 \\mod{10_2}$\nNext, we note that the second bit of $a_1$ is $1$, so we must also have $c_1 = 1$ in order to zero it out, giving\n\\[a_2 \\equiv 10111_2 \\times 11_2 \\equiv 101110_2 + a_1 \\equiv 1000101_2 \\equiv 01_2 \\mod{100_2}\\]\n$a_{n+1} = a_{n}$ happens precisely when $c_n = 0$. In fact we can see this in action by working out $a_3$. Note that $a_2$ has 1 on the $2$nd bit, so we must choose $c_2 = 1$. This gives \n\\[a_3 \\equiv 10111_2 \\times 111_2 \\equiv 1011100_2 + a_2 \\equiv 10100001_2 \\equiv 001_2 \\mod{1000_2}\\]\nNote that since the $3$rd and $4$th bit are $0$, $c_3 = c_4 = 0$, and this gives $a_3 = a_4 = a_5$.\n\nIt may seem that this process will take forever, but note that $23 = 10111_2$ has $4$ bits behind the leading digit, and in the worst case, the leading digits of $a_n$ will have a cycle length of at most $16$. In fact, we find that the cycle length is $11$, and in the process found that $a_3 = a_4 = a_5$, $a_6 = a_7$, and $a_{11} = a_{12}$.\nSince we have $90$ complete cycles of length $11$, and the last partial cycle yields $a_{993} = a_{994} = a_{995}$ and $a_{996} = a_{997}$, we have a total of $90 \\times 4 + 3 = \\boxed{363}$ values of $n \\le 1000$ such that $a_n = a_{n+1}$\n~ cocoa @ [https://www.corgillogical.com](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://www.corgillogical.com)", "answer": "363"}

I used Vieta's Formulas to get a possible list, but you could also use the rational root theorem and synthetic division to find these. We call the three values of y that solve this equation: $y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}$\nUsing Vieta's Formulas, you get these three expressions:\n\\[y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} = 0\\]\n\\[y_{1} * y_{2} * y_{3} = -240\\]\n\\[(y_{1} * y_{2}) + (y_{2} * y_{3}) + (y_{1} * y_{3}) = -76\\]\nIn addition, we know that $y \\vert 60$, because of our expression for x. \nSince the three values of y multiply to a negative number but also add to 0, we know that one value is negative and the other two are positive, and that the absolute value of the negative value is greater than both of the positive values.\nList of possible values for y are $\\{-60,-30,-20,-15,-12,-10,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60\\}$\nFrom a list of these values, the only values that work are $y_1 = -10, y_2 = 6, y_3 = 4$ because\n\\[-10 + 6 + 4 = 0\\]\n\\[-10 * 6 * 4 = -240\\]\n\\[(-10 * 6) + (-10 * 4) + (6 * 4) = -60 - 40 + 24 = -76\\]\nPlugging in these values for y into our expression for x, we get:\n\\[x = \\frac{60}{-10} - 4 = -10\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{60}{6} - 4 = 6\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{60}{4} - 4 = 11\\]\nSo, now we have accounted for both cases, and we have 4 values of x = $\\{-10,4,6,11\\}$\nSquaring all these terms we get: 100 + 16 + 36 + 121 = 273, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(273)}}$\n~Cardtricks\nSince all three equations are in the form $\\frac{K}{a} + 4a = 60$ where $K = xyz$, we can rearrange this to see that $x$, $y$, and $z$ all satisfy \n\\[ 4a^2 - 60a + K = 0. \\]\nLet this quadratic have roots $a_1$ and $a_2$. Then, there are two cases to consider: two of $x$, $y$, $z$ are equal to $a_1$ and the third is equal to $a_2$, or all of $x$, $y$, $z$ are equal to $a_1$.\nCase 1: WLOG let $x = y = a_1$ and $z = a_2$.\nThen by Vieta's,\n\\[x + z = 15 \\hspace{1cm} (1)\\]\n\\[xz = \\frac{x^2z}{4} \\hspace{1cm} (2)\\]\nwhich gives $x = y = 4$ and $z = 11$. But we can swap $x$, $y$, and $z$ however we like, so this also gives $x = 11$ as a solution. In total, this case yields $x = 4$ and $x = 11$ as possible values of $x$.\nCase 2: WLOG let $x = y = z = a_1$.\nAgain, by Vieta's,\n\\[x + a_2 = 15 \\hspace{1cm} (1)\\]\n\\[xa_2 = \\frac{x^3}{4} \\hspace{1cm} (2)\\]\nWe can use $(2)$ to isolate $a_2$ in terms of $x$, then plug that into $(1)$ to get that $x^2 + 4x - 60 = 0$. This yields $x = -10$ and $x = 6$ as additional possible values of $x$.\nIn all, $x$ can be any of $\\{ 4, 11, -10, 6 \\}$, so the requested answer is $4^2 + 11^2 + (-10)^2 + 6^2 = \\boxed{273}.$\nWe index these equations as (1), (2), and (3) respectively (same as solution 2). There are two possible cases:\nCase 1: $x = \\pm 4$\nIn this case, we simply plug in $x = 4$ and $x = -4$. We note that $x=4$ is a valid case.\nCase 2: $x \\neq \\pm 4$\nIn this case, using equation (3), we get $y = 15 - \\frac{xz}{4}$. Plugging that into equation (1), we get $z = \\frac{240-60x}{16-x^2}$. Plugging that expression back into the original expression for $y$ we obtain $y = 15 - \\frac{60x-15x^2}{16-x^2}$. \nNow we plug these two expressions into equation (2):\n\\[\\left(15 - \\frac{60x-15x^2}{16-x^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{240-60x}{16-x^2}\\right) = 60-4x\\]\nmultiplying both sides by $(16-x^2)$ and factoring, we get:\n\\[\\left(15(4-x)(4+x)-60x+15x^2\\right)\\left(\\frac{60(4-x)}{(4+x)(4-x)}\\right) = 4(15 - x)(4 + x)(4 - x)\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[x^3 - 7x^2 - 104x + 660 = 0\\]\nwe note that $x = 6$ is a root. Factoring, we get the other roots, -10 and 11. \nOur desired answer is the sum of the square of all these roots: \\[4^2 + 6^2 + (-10)^2 + 11^2 = \\boxed{273}\\]\n~Chupdogs", "answer": "273"}
